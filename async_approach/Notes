Synchronous Approach:

Synchronous Code is executed in sequence.
Each Statement waits for the preveious statement to finish before executing.

Asynchronous Approach:

Asynchronous code doesn't have to wait.
Although, your program can continue to run.
It helps reducing the wait time for the user.

To write async code in JS/Node.js, you can use:
    1. Callback
    2. Promises
    3. async/await
